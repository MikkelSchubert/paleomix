# Default options.
# Can also be specific for a set of samples, libraries, and lanes,
# by including the "Options" hierarchy at the same level as those
# samples, libraries, or lanes below. This does not include
# "Features", which may only be specific globally.
Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33
  # Split a lane into multiple entries, one for each (pair of) file(s)
  # found using the search-string specified for a given lane. Each
  # lane is named by adding a number to the end of the given barcode.

      # Filter reads that did not map to the reference sequence
      FilterUnmappedReads: yes
      # May be disabled ("no") for aDNA alignments, as post-mortem damage

  # Mark / filter PCR duplicates. If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are
