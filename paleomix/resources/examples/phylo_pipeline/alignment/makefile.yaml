Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment

     # Some BAM pipeline defaults differ from AR defaults;
     # To override, change these value(s):
     --mm: 3

      # have few errors (sets "-l"). See http://pmid.us/22574660
      UseSeed: yes
      # Additional command-line options may be specified below. For 'backtrack' these

  # Set to 'yes' exclude a type of trimmed reads from alignment / analysis;

  ExcludeReads:
    # Exclude single-end reads (yes / no)?
    Single: no
    # Exclude non-collapsed paired-end reads (yes / no)?

    Singleton: no
    # Exclude overlapping paired-ended reads collapsed into a single sequence

    Collapsed: no
    # Like 'Collapsed', but only for collapsed reads truncated due to the
    # presence of ambiguous or low quality bases at read termini (yes / no).
    CollapsedTruncated: no

  # Optional steps to perform during processing.
  Features:
    # If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are removed from the output files; if set to
    # 'mark', PCR duplicates are flagged with bit 0x400, and not removed from the
    # output files; if set to 'no', the reads are assumed to not have been amplified.
    PCRDuplicates: filter
    # Set to 'no' to disable mapDamage; set to 'plots' to build basic mapDamage plots;
    # set to 'model' to build plots and postmortem damage models; and set to 'rescale'
    # to build plots, models, and BAMs with rescaled quality scores. All analyses are
    # carried out per library.
    mapDamage: no
    # Generate coverage information for the final BAM and for each 'RegionsOfInterest'

    Coverage: yes
    # Generate histograms of number of sites with a given read-depth, from 0 to 200,

    Depths: yes
    # Generate summary table for each target (yes / no)
    Summary: yes


# Map of prefixes by name, each having a Path, which specifies the location of the
# BWA/Bowtie2 index, and optional regions for which additional statistics are produced.
Prefixes:
  # Replace 'NAME_OF_PREFIX' with name of the prefix; this name is used in summary
  # statistics and as part of output filenames.
  rCRS:
    # Replace 'PATH_TO_PREFIX' with the path to .fasta file containing the references
    # against which reads are to be mapped. Using the same name as filename is strongly
    # recommended (e.g. /path/to/Human_g1k_v37.fasta should be named 'Human_g1k_v37').
    Path: prefixes/rCRS.fasta

    # (Optional) Uncomment and replace 'PATH_TO_BEDFILE' with the path to a .bed file
    # listing extra regions for which coverage / depth statistics should be calculated;
    # if no names are specified for the BED records, results are named after the
    # chromosome / contig. Replace 'NAME' with the desired name for these regions.
#    RegionsOfInterest:
