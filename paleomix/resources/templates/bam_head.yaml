  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33
