"""Version checks for apps or libraries required by PALEOMIX pipelines.

The module contains to sets of classes: RequirementObj and Check. The
RequirementObj class implements the determation of the current version for a
given tool, while the Check (sub)classes implements various comparison
to be carried against the detected version (less than, greater than or equal,
etc.).

To reduce the overhead of detmining versions (which mostly involve invoking
external programs), the RequirementObj caches results. Additionally, to avoid
redundant calls, RequirementObjs are created using the 'Requirement' function
which caches RequirementObjs.

For example, to check that the Java version is v1.7 or later:
    obj = Requirement(call=("java", "-version"),
                      search='java version "(\\d+).(\\d+)',
                      checks=GE(1, 7),
                      name="Java Runtime Environment")
    try:
        obj()
    except VersionRequirementError:
        pass  # requirements not met, or failure to determine version

    which may be used to check that version requirements are met for a
    given program/utility/module, etc.

    Parameters:
      call   -- A string, or a tuple containing strings for a system call,
                or a tuple containing a function at the first position, and
                a set of positional parameters. In the case of system calls,
                stdout and stderr are returned as a single string, in the case
                of a function call, the return value is expected to be a str.
      search -- A regular expression (string or re object), used to search
                the output of the "call". Groups are assumed to represent
                version numbers.
      checks -- A callable that implements the interface described in the
                Check class.
      name   -- Descriptive name for the executable/module/etc. If not
                specified, first value in 'call' will be used; if multiple
                otherwise identical checks are made, the last name that
                does not equal the first value of 'call' will be used.
      priority -- Order in which requirements are checked; if multiple
                  otherwise identical checks are made with different priority,
                  the highest priority takes precedence.

    Implementation detail: To reduce the need for performing calls or system-
    calls multiple times, caches are implemented using the call object as keys.
    Thus the same calls should be passed in a manner which allow equality
    between the same calls to be established.
