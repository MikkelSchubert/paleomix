# Default options.
# Can also be specific for a set of samples, libraries, and lanes,
# by including the "Options" hierarchy at the same level as those
# samples, libraries, or lanes below. This does not include
# "Features", which may only be specific globally.
Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33
  # Split a lane into multiple entries, one for each (pair of) file(s)
  # found using the search-string specified for a given lane. Each
  # lane is named by adding a number to the end of the given barcode.
  SplitLanesByFilenames: yes
  # Compression format for FASTQ reads; 'gz' for GZip, 'bz2' for BZip2
  CompressionFormat: bz2

  # Settings for trimming of reads, see AdapterRemoval man-page
#  AdapterRemoval:
     # Adapter sequences, set and uncomment to override defaults
#     --pcr1: ...
#     --pcr2: ...
     # Pipeline defaults that differ from AR defaults;
     # To override, change the value(s) and uncomment the line(s):
#     --mm: 3
#     --minlength: 25
     # Features enabled by default; uncomment to disable:
#     --collapse: no
#     --trimns: no

  # Settings for aligners supported by the pipeline
  Aligners:
    # Choice of aligner software to use, either "BWA" or "Bowtie2"
    Program: BWA

    # Settings for mappings performed using BWA
    BWA:
      # Filter hits with a mapping quality (Phred) below this value
      MinQuality: 30
      # Filter reads that did not map to the reference sequence
      FilterUnmappedReads: yes
      # Should be disabled ("no") for aDNA alignments, as post-mortem
      # localizes to the seed region, which BWA expects to have few
      # errors (sets "-l"). See http://pmid.us/22574660
      UseSeed:    yes
      # Additional command-line options may be specified for the "aln"

  # Mark / filter PCR duplicates. If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates
  # are removed from the output files; if set to 'mark', these are
  # flagged with bit 0x400; if set to 'no', the reads are assumed to
  # not have been amplified. Collapsed reads are filtered using the
  # command 'bam_rmdup_duplicates', while "normal" reads are filtered
  # using Picard MarkDuplicates.
  PCRDuplicates: filter

  # Carry out quality base re-scaling of libraries using mapDamage
  # This will be done using the options set for mapDamage below
  RescaleQualities: yes

  # Command-line options for mapDamage; note that the long-form
  # options are expected; --length, not -l, etc. Uncomment the
  # "mapDamage" line adding command-line options below.
  mapDamage:
    # By default, the pipeline will downsample the input to 100k hits
    # when running mapDamage; remove to use all hits

  # Exclude a type of trimmed reads from alignment/analysis; possible
  # types reflect the output of AdapterRemoval
#  ExcludeReads:
#    - Single    # Single-ended reads / Orphaned paired-ended reads
#    - Paired    # Paired ended reads
#    - Collapsed # Overlapping paired-ended reads collapsed into a
                 # single sequence by AdapterRemoval
#    - CollapsedTruncated # Like 'Collapsed', except that the reads
                          # truncated due to the presence ambigious
                          # bases or low quality bases at termini.
